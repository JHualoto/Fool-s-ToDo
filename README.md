# The Fool's To-Do

# Description

## To-Do Challenge
Create a small TODO application. Our hope is that you'll find this project a bit like a blank canvas, you can fill it in however you please to show us something about yourself, thought process, and development style. 

## As a user: 
* You'll be able to create new tasks and assign each task to someone. 
* Feel the need to update your task? Hit the Edit button to display a modal which will allow you to update the task name. 
* If you were productive enough, delete old tasks and start fresh! Enjoy!


## Reflections

  This project allowed me to further practice the skills that I've gained thus far as a software developer. Since my technical bootcamp's curriculum revolved around the PERN stack, I wanted to showcase a minimal viable product using relevant technologies. When building out this small application, I learned that having a strong sense of technical ability and foresight for building out a competent file structure is important. However, this challenge brought on various small hurdles that proved to take more time than I would've liked such as: setting up a template from scratch, minor webpack issues, deciding the best route for quick design implementation(bootstrap, flexbox, styled components, etc) along with other minor set backs such as: logging out to see responses from api endpoints, reading documentation for appropriate sequelize methods, and implementing a modal which contains the desired text for updating. Lastly and most importantly, this challenge has taught me to be more patient with myself and the journey that comes with learning/relearning concepts as I further progress into this career path. 

## Stretch Features/Improvements

### If given the chance to further expand on this project, I would:
- Add cosmetic updates to make the application more appealing/responsive.
- To create a more organized/condensed file structure, implement Styled components for styling.
- Create a button which would filter and alphabetize tasks by name or assignee.
- As an alternative to the above enhancement, implement React Beautiful Drag and drop to re-order items dynamically
- Refactor code to update displayed data upon task creation
- Make the application mobile friendly implementing a new framework such as: React Native.
