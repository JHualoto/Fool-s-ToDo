# The Fool's To-Do

# Description

## To-Do Challenge
Create a small TODO application. Our hope is that you'll find this project a bit like a blank canvas, you can fill it in however you please to show us something about yourself, thought process, and development style. 

* As a user, you'll be able to create new tasks and assign each task to someone. 
* Feel the need to update your task? Hit the Edit button to display a modal which will allow you to update the task name. 
* If you were productive enough, delete old tasks and start fresh! Enjoy!

## Stretch Features/Improvements

- If given the chance to further expand on this project, I would:
- Add cosmetic updates to make the application more appealing/Responsive.
- To create a more organized/condensed file structure, implement Styled components for styling.
- Create a button which would filter and alphabetize tasks by name or assignee.
- Make the application mobile friendly implementing a new framework such as: React Native.
